In the top you should see which players turn it is <br>
* The player needs to select a piece they want to move * 
* The user will gain acces to a roll button to roll the dice. * <br>
** Note: If the player is a CPU one of the local players needs to still click the roll button for the AI However the AI will chose the piece it wants to move** <br>
